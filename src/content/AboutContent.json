  "text": "Our future vision is to develop a complete zero-waste system from water hyacinth, where stems are used for fiber, leaves are converted into paper and packaging, and roots are used for biogas production. Through this integrated approach, we aim to clean polluted water bodies while ensuring that no part of the plant is discarded. By combining environmental restoration with sustainable production, we envision a circular model that generates income, reduces pollution, and supports long-term community resilience.",
